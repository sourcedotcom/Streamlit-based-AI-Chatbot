# Streamlit-based AI Chatbot : https://app-based-ai-chatbot-vxcivg3jsoexlyvzch8m7g.streamlit.app/
Building a LLM Chatbot using Google's Gemini Pro with Streamlit Python, this project delivers a lightweight web application for real-time AI-powered conversations through an interactive Streamlit interface. Built in Python, the app integrates with the Gemini Pro API to provide intelligent, context-aware responses while maintaining chat history during each session. It features a straightforward setup processâ€”clone the repository, install dependencies from requirements.txt, configure your GEMINI_API_KEY in a .env file, and launch with streamlit run app.py. Designed for easy deployment locally or on cloud platforms like Streamlit Cloud, the chatbot leverages libraries such as streamlit and dotenv for functionality and configuration. The project is flexible and extensible, with planned enhancements including user authentication, database-backed chat history, and multimodal query support.
